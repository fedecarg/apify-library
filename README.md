# Introduction

Web services are a great way to extend your application, however,
adding a Web API to an existing web application can be a tedious and
time-consuming task. Apify is a small web application that was developed
to ease that pain. It takes certain common patterns found in most web
services and abstract them so that you can quickly write Web APIs
without having to write too much code.

### Demos 

To demonstrate the possibilities of Apify and to show how it works work within a common user interface, I've created the following demo applications which are listed below.
